/*Multiple Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) where a single child class (subclass) can inherit from more than one parent class (superclasses).

This allows the child class to combine features and behaviors from multiple classes.
*/
// Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces in Dart):
// Dart doesn't support multiple inheritance through extends but does support implementing multiple interfaces.

implements diye ami bolsi:

‚ÄúAmi Father o Mother class er interface follow korbo.‚Äù

But implements use korle, Father ar Mother er method gulo asole inherit hoy na!
amke nijer theke sob method abar likhte hoy!

Sejonno @override lagchhe, bujhaiye dite je
Ei method Father/Mother class theke asche
Ami etar notun implementation dicchi

üî• Example in Real Life:
Imagine a SmartPhone:

It inherits features from a Phone (calls, SMS).
It also inherits features from a Camera (photos, videos).
A SmartPhone can do both, combining two functionalities.
