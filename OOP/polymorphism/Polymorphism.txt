What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means "many forms".
In programming, polymorphism allows objects to take many forms.
It lets us call the same method on different types of objects, and each object responds differently.

✅ Why use polymorphism?

Makes code flexible and reusable.
Encourages code generalization (working with interfaces or base classes).
Simplifies code management and reduces duplication.

✅ Step 1: Understanding the Basics of Polymorphism
There are two main types of polymorphism:

Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)
⚠️ Dart does NOT support method overloading.

Run-time polymorphism (Method Overriding)
✅ Dart supports this!
